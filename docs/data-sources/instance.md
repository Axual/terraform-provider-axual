page_title: "Data Source: axual_instance"
---
This data source allows you to retrieve an existing instance from Self-Service by referencing either its `name` or `short_name`.
While both options are available, it is recommended to use `short_name` for better uniqueness and consistency.
You must provide at least one of `name` or `short_name`. If both are specified, the instance data will be resolved and exported based on the `short_name`.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "axual_instance" "testInstance" {
 short_name = "test"
}
```

```hcl
data "axual_instance" "testInstance" {
 name = "testInstance"
}
```

## Argument Reference

- name - (Optional) The instance name.
- short_name - (Optional) The instance shortName.

## Attribute Reference

This data source exports the following attributes in addition to the one listed above:

- id instance unique identifier.
- short_name The instance short name.
- description The instance description.

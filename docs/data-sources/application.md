page_title: "Data Source: axual_application"
---
This data source allows you to retrieve an existing application from Self-Service by referencing either its `name` or `short_name`.
While both options are available, it is recommended to use `short_name` for better uniqueness and consistency.
You must provide at least one of `name` or `short_name`. If both are specified, the application data will be resolved and exported based on the `short_name`.

## Example Usage
```hcl
data "axual_application" "logs_producer" {
  short_name = "logs"
}
```

```hcl
data "axual_application" "logs_producer" {
  name = "logs_producer"
}
```

# axual_application_principal (Resource)

An Application Principal is a security principal (certificate or comparable) that uniquely authenticates an Application on an Environment. Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2024.1/self-service/application-management.html#configuring-application-securityauthentication

## Limitations
- Axual Terraform Provider only support these authentication methods:
	- SSL (MUTUAL TLS) as a Certificate(PEM). To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as `principal` property.
	- SASL (OAUTHBEARER) as a Custom Principal that specifies the ID referenced in URI and tokens. To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as principal property. For example, `my-client`.

## Security
- If using Application Principal for a Connector application private key is required.
   - If committing terraform configuration(.tf) file in version control repository, please make sure there is a secure way of providing private key for a Connector application's Application Principal.
   - Here are best practices for handling secrets in Terraform: https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-handle-secrets-in-terraform/
   - The query from this Terraform provider to Axual Platform Manager API is secured with a TLS connection, just like in Axual Self Service UI.

## Required Roles
- APPLICATION_ADMIN or be part of the Team that owns the Application

## Schema

### Required

- `application` (String) A valid ID of an existing application
- `environment` (String) A valid Uid of an existing environment
- `principal` (String, Sensitive) The principal of an Application for an Environment. Must be PEM-format.

### Optional

- `custom` (Boolean) A boolean identifying whether we are creating a custom principal. If true, the custom principal will be stored in `principal` property. Custom principal allows an application with SASL+OAUTHBEARER to produce/consume a topic. Custom Application Principal certificate is used to authenticate your application with an IAM provider using the custom ApplicationPrincipal as Client ID
- `private_key` (String, Sensitive) The private key of a Connector Application for an Environment. Must be PEM-format. If committing terraform configuration(.tf) file in version control repository, please make sure there is a secure way of providing private key for a Connector application's Application Principal. Here are best practices for handling secrets in Terraform: https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-handle-secrets-in-terraform/.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Application Principal ID

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "axual_application_principal" "dev_dashboard_in_dev_principal" {
  environment = axual_environment.development.id
  application = axual_application.dev_dashboard.id
  principal = file("certs/certificate.pem")
}

resource "axual_application_principal" "example_connector_application" {
  environment = axual_environment.development.id
  application = axual_application.dev_dashboard.id
  principal = file("certs/certificate.pem")
  private_key = file("certs/example-connector.key")
}

resource "axual_application_principal" "example_sasl_oathbearer_app_principal" {
  environment = "c82f56c4f8064a729e393c04f031c7bf"
  application = "2de280a38df6490ea4ccf2f9b6e649a4"
  principal = "example-principal"
  custom = true
}
```

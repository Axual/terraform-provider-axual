# axual_application_principal (Resource)

An ApplicationPrincipal is a security principal (certificate or comparable) that uniquely authenticates an Application on an Environment. Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2023.2/self-service/application-management.html#configuring-application-securityauthentication

## Limitations
- Axual Terraform Provider only support these authentication methods:
	- SSL (MUTUAL TLS) as a Certificate(PEM). To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as principal property.
	- SASL (OAUTHBEARER) as a Custom Principal that specifies the ID referenced in URI and tokens. To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as principal property. For example, 'my-client'.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "axual_application_principal" "dev_dashboard_in_dev_principal" {

  application = axual_application.dev_dashboard.id
  principal = file("certs/certificate.pem")
}
```

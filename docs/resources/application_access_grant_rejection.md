## Schema

### Required

- `application_access_grant` (String) Application Access Grant Unique Identifier.

### Optional

- `reason` (String) Reason for denying approval.

## State Synchronization

~> **Important:** After creating this resource, the `axual_application_access_grant` resource's `status` attribute in Terraform state will still show "Pending" until you run `terraform apply` or `terraform refresh` to update the state file.

### Why This Happens

This is expected Terraform behavior. When one resource modifies another resource via the API, Terraform's state for the modified resource is not automatically updated. The state file is only updated when you run `terraform apply` or `terraform refresh`.

~> **Note:** In normal workflows, you won't notice this issue because `terraform apply` reads current state from the API during its refresh phase, showing you accurate information. However, the state **file** itself is only updated when you run `terraform apply` or `terraform refresh`. The stale state only matters if you inspect the state file directly without running one of these commands first.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "axual_application_access_grant_rejection" "scraper_produce_logs_staging_rejection" {
  application_access_grant = axual_application_access_grant.scraper_produce_to_logs_in_staging.id
  depends_on = [ axual_application_access_grant.scraper_produce_to_logs_in_staging ]
}
```

## Import

Application Access Grant Rejection can be imported using the grant's UID:

```shell
terraform import axual_application_access_grant_rejection.example 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

### Prerequisites

- The grant must exist and be in "Rejected" status
- If the grant is not in "Rejected" status, import will fail (the rejection resource is removed from state)

### The `reason` Attribute

The `reason` attribute is stored as `comment` in the API. After import, the reason will be correctly populated from the API response.

### Notes

- The grant UID can be found in the Axual Self-Service UI or via the API
- After import, the `application_access_grant` attribute will contain the grant UID

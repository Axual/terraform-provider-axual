# axual_application_credential (Resource)

An Application Credential is a security credential (SASL) that uniquely authenticates an Application in an Environment. Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2024.4/self-service/application-management.html#configuring-application-securityauthentication

## Security
- Since password is a `sensitive` field, Terraform Provider will not print the password in `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` output.
- Terraform will save the password and username in local state file(terraform.tfstate). Please make sure that this file is appropriately secured.
- Here are best practices for securing secrets in Terraform: https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-handle-secrets-in-terraform/

## Required Roles
- APPLICATION_ADMIN or be part of the Team that owns the Application

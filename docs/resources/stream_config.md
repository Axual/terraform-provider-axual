## Schema

### Required

- `environment` (String) The environment this stream configuration is associated with
- `partitions` (Number) The number of partitions define how many consumer instances can be started in parallel on this stream. Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2022.2/self-service/stream-management.html#partitions-number
- `properties` (Map of String) You can define Kafka properties for your stream here. segment.ms property needs to always be included. Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2022.1/self-service/stream-management.html#configuring-a-stream-for-an-environment
- `retention_time` (Number) Determine how long the messages should be available on a stream. There should be an agreed value most likely discussed in Intake session with the team supporting Axual Platform. In most cases, it is 7 days.

- `stream` (String) The Stream this stream configuration is associated with

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) stream config identifier

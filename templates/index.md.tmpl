# Axual Provider

Axual Provider allows using Axual's Self-Service for Apache Kafka functionality within Terraform configurations.

## Axual Self Service
- Self Service allows fine-grained access control over your applications and streams, who is accessing your streams and for what purpose.
- Self Service displays valuable metadata about streams and the applications interacting with them, such as:
	- The format of the data thatâ€™s present on the stream
	- How long until the data is removed from the stream
	- Which applications are the producers and the consumers of this data
- Self Service provides control your stream (topic) properties for individual environments, and get an overview of the streaming landscape inside your organization.
	- For details, please refer to Axual Self-Service reference documentation: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2022.2/self-service/index.html

## Features

- User/group management
- Stream and application management
- Security
	- To secure which applications are authorised to access streams, we support
		- SSL (MUTUAL TLS) as a Certificate(PEM)
		- SASL (OAUTHBEARER) as a Custom Principal that specifies the ID referenced in URI and tokens. For example, 'my-client'

## Limitations
- **The environment that user creates needs to have this setting: Authorization issuer-Auto**
  - Manual approval will be supported in later version of Axual Terraform Provider.

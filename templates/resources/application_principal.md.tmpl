## Limitations
- Axual Terraform Provider only support these authentication methods:
	- SSL (MUTUAL TLS) as a Certificate(PEM). To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as `principal` property.
		- Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2024.4/self-service/application-management.html#ssl-application-principals
	- SASL (OAUTHBEARER) as a Custom Principal that specifies the ID referenced in URI and tokens. To use it please provide a string with PEM certificate as principal property. For example, `my-client`.
		- Read more: https://docs.axual.io/axual/2024.4/self-service/application-management.html#application-custom-principal
- We currently do not support these authentication methods SASL(scram-sha-256) nor SASL(scram-sha-512) authentication methods, both are planned to be supported soon.

## Security
- If using Application Principal for a Connector application private key is required.
   - If committing terraform configuration(.tf) file in version control repository, please make sure there is a secure way of providing private key for a Connector application's Application Principal.
   - Here are best practices for handling secrets in Terraform: https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-handle-secrets-in-terraform/
   - The query from this Terraform provider to Axual Platform Manager API is secured with a TLS connection, just like in Axual Self Service UI.

## Required Roles
- APPLICATION_ADMIN or be part of the Team that owns the Application

  principal = file("certs/certificate.pem")
}

resource "axual_application_principal" "example_connector_application" {
  environment = axual_environment.development.id
  application = axual_application.dev_dashboard.id
  principal = file("certs/certificate.pem")
  private_key = file("certs/example-connector.key")
}

resource "axual_application_principal" "example_sasl_oathbearer_app_principal" {
  environment = "c82f56c4f8064a729e393c04f031c7bf"
  application = "2de280a38df6490ea4ccf2f9b6e649a4"

  custom = true
}

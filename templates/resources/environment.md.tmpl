## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import axual_environment.<LOCAL NAME> <ENVIRONMENT UID>
terraform import axual_environment.test_env ab1cf1d63a55436391463cee3f56e393
```

### Import limitation
If a resource lacks properties or settings, set properties = null or settings = null in the .tf file, or omit the block entirely. Avoid using properties = {} or settings = {} during imports, as this creates a mismatch between Terraformâ€™s local state (null) and configuration (empty map {}). Fixing this mismatch requires an extra update.

This is a temporary workaround; a permanent fix is in progress. The issue only occurs when properties or settings are set to an empty map. Imports work fine for properties/settings that are either defined or null.

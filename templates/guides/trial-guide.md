page_title: "Connecting Terraform to the Axual Trial Environment (Auth0)"
---

Getting Terraform talking to the Axual SaaS trial is a **three-step** process:

1. **Sign up for a free trial**
2. **Configure the Terraform provider with Auth0**
3. **Create resources in your personal trial cluster**

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Request a trial account

1. Go to **Get started ‚Üí Start free trial** at <https://axual.com/get-started>.
2. Click **Sign up**.
3. Pick **‚ÄúTry Axual Cluster‚Äù**.
4. Enter your *Organisation name* and your *first* and *last* name, then finish the signup flow.

---

## Step 2 ‚Äì Initialise the provider (Auth0 flow)

Create a `provider.tf` and paste the **provider** block below.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    axual = {
      source  = "axual/axual"
      version = "<Replace with latest version>"
    }
  }
}

provider "axual" {
  apiurl   = "https://app.axual.cloud/api"

  # üîë Replace these two lines
  username = "<INSERT_USERNAME>"   # your trial e-mail
  password = "<INSERT_PASSWORD>"   # your trial password

  clientid = "eY6aEMAO8XAkoKE9e9pZFcOs7Wxs6VBQ"

  authurl  = "https://axual.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token"
  scopes   = ["openid", "profile", "email"]
  audience = "https://app.axual.cloud/api"
  authmode = "auth0"
}
```


---

## Step 3 ‚Äì Reference existing objects & create your own

Because the trial cluster is pre-seeded with core objects:

- Users are created only during self-registration, so use a **axual_user** data source to look yourself up.

- Clusters / Instances already exist. Reference them with **axual_instance** data source.


```hcl
#Ô∏è Look up yourself by e-mail ‚Äì change the address
data "axual_user" "me" {
  email = "my-email@email.com"
}

# Pick the shared trial instance by name
data "axual_instance" "trial" {
  name = "Non-Production"
}
```
Now build your own group, environment, application, topic, ACLs, etc.

```hcl

  partitions      = 1
  retention_time  = 864000            # 10 days
  properties      = {
    "segment.ms"      = "600012"

  ]
}

resource "axual_application_access_grant_approval" "produce_logs_approval" {
  application_access_grant = axual_application_access_grant.produce_logs.id
}
```

Run **terraform apply** and confirm the plan ‚Äì Terraform will:
- Create a group containing you.
- Create a development environment in the shared trial instance.
- Register an application + credentials.
- Provision a topic with ACL-s in that environment.
- Grant & approve produce rights for the application on the topic.

## What‚Äôs next?

- Open **/overview** in the Axual Self-Service UI ‚Üí you should visually see the application producing to logs.
- Wire any Java (or other) client to the cluster using the credential JSON returned by the **axual_application_credential**.
  - Since password is a sensitive field, Terraform Provider will not print the password in **terraform plan** or **terraform apply** output.
  - Terraform will save the password and username in local state file(**terraform.tfstate**). Please make sure that this file is appropriately secured.
- Produce using for example a Java client and Browse messages in UI using Topic Browse to verify messages delivery.
